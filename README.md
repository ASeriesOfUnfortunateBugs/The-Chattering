# The-Chattering

This was the final project for my Java Programming II class. The assignment was to build a basic chat program between a client and a server.

I used Scene Builder to create the UI portion of the program then coded everything else using NetBeans.

If you would like to see a demostration video for this project, [I have one available here](https://youtu.be/pnumEMfOHS8).

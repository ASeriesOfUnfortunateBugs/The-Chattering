# The-Chattering

This was the final project for my Java Programming II class. The assignment was to build a basic chat program that shares messages between a client and a server. Additionally, I was required to build a very simple GUI that the instructor set the requirements for. The requirements for this project were

* Use sockets and threads to create a program that will send and receive messages across the network
* Build one UI that can be used for both programs
    * Include a text area at the top of the window to display messages
    * Include a text field at the bottom of the window for sending messages
    * Include a send button

I began the project by creating the UI portion using Scene Builder. The instructor had given pretty clear instructions about what he wanted in the GUI so I kept it very simple. Afterwards, I made a quick structure chart to help me plan and visualize the basics of the program.

After the design process was finished, I moved to NetBeans to start coding. My biggest hurdle while developing this program was figuring out the threads. I went back to my class materials many times to review the information on threads before I was finally able to work it out. I was so proud when I was finally able to puzzle it out and get the program functioning. For my efforts, I got a 100 on this assignment.
